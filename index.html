      <h4>Conflict Resolution</h4>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="large-8 columns">
          <p>The pathway to conflict resolution is seldom a clear one.  Injury, loss, damage, and general competing interest  often create a landscape of pit falls and hurdles that seem impossible to overcome in the face of litigation.  Through the use of a qualified mediator parties can work to resolve their differences and find common ground that will allow them to be heard, to find a peaceful and meaningful resolution and avoid what can so easily become a long, drawn out litigation process.  Sheppard Futrell, PLLC is a law firm that focuses on helping individuals with competing interest find that common ground and in the process resolve their differences in a way that not only results in less conflict but also in more peace of mind.</p>
          <p>Through mediation parties in conflict negotiate a resolution through the help of a skilled third party neutral.  By having an opportunity to talk through differing positions the mediator helps the parties to the mediation reach a mutually acceptable resolution of their dispute; and end result that both parties can be satisfied with.  Mediation helps make an otherwise adversarial situation into a situation of reconciliation and growth.</p>

          <p><strong>Mediation:</strong> is an informal dispute settlement process run by a trained third party, called a mediator. Mediation is intended to bring two parties together to clear up misunderstandings, find out concerns, and reach a resolution. The process of mediation is voluntary.</p>
